IF people are making changes and it is in the form of a buff of some kind, i request that a few rules are abided by

If you want to increase base damage by 1000, do it by 100, incrimental buffs over full sending it for a more streamlined balance, this is more personal since its how I've handled it so far

Guns will not recieve power draw

If anyone intends on making major changes to the weapon at least message me on discord first or ping me, id rather be pestered in regards to things about my weapons and i'll give green light or "half of that" sort of saying

Current known issues that I need aid in fixing: Particles and possibly sounds.
